# Prodigy InfoTech Internship - Task 05: Neural Style Transfer

## 📌 Task Objective

Apply the artistic style of one image (e.g., a painting) to the content of another image (e.g., a photo) using a deep learning model called **Neural Style Transfer**.

## 🧠 Model Used

- TensorFlow Hub’s Pretrained Neural Style Transfer model
- Based on CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)

## 🎯 What I Did

- Loaded content and style images using TensorFlow
- Preprocessed and resized both images
- Applied the style transfer model
- Displayed and saved the final stylized output

## 🖼️ Inputs & Outputs

| Image Type | Preview |
|------------|---------|
| Content    | `content_image.jpg` |
| Style      | `style_image.jpg` |
| Output     | `stylized_image.jpg` |
